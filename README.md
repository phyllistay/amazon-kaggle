Taking a similar concept to Recency-Frequency-Monetary (RFM) scoring, I did computed a score based on the following:
- No of years the book appears in best selling list from 2009 to 2019
- How recent the book got on the best selling list
- No of Reviews
- User Rating

Score is averaged and scaled with a max of 5

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sootersaalu/amazon-top-50-bestselling-books-2009-2019

I created a Tableau dashboard to visualise the findings: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/phyllis.tay/viz/TopAmazonBooks/Top10Picks
